What part of the test did i find chanllenging?

The design aspect of the test was the hardest, because i had to incorporate collection view in table view cells and to return the correct width and height, i had to do R&D in order to acheive the desired output. i tried several things like layoutDidLayoutSubviews among other methods but this helped me in learning how to dynamically update the size, and correctly configure the settings for the output. 


what feature would i like to improve ? 

If i am guided towards what sort of animations should be there, and if the UI is provided for them it would be helpful in terms of the appeal. some sort of help or hints for the approach we should adopt for the UI would also go a long way in making things easier.
